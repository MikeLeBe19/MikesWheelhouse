          <h1 id="section-home">Welcome to my Wheelhouse!</h1>
          <p>
            I am a Software Engineer that brings ideas to digital fruition. I
            create applications from start to finish, and front to back. Working
            and communicating well with others, as well as independently, leads
            me to asking the right questions to develop user stories and turn
            them into sprints within an agile software development lifecycle. I
            enjoy learning new tech and refining my skills with tech I already
            know by using AlgoExpert and Codewars.
          </p>
          <h1 id="#section-about">About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Veteran, Programmer, and life-long learner. <br /><br />I was a 68W
            (Health Care Specialist) in the United States Army. I joined the
            military one year after graduating high school. I wasn't sure what
            it was that I wanted to do, so I invested in myself and took the
            patriotic leap to serve my country. During my time of service, I met
            many exceptional Soldiers. I was fortunate enough to have crossed
            paths with great mentors and it was through them that I was
            introduced to programming. I am extremely proud of my military
            service and how it has shaped me as a person, professional, and
            everything between. <br /><br />After my 5 years of service, I went
            to school. Through my years of school, I found software development
            to be what I wanted to do. I enrolled in Full Stack Academy to
            reinforce what I had learned and pave the way for improvements. I
            was able to transfer my soft skills from the military to the
            software engineering field, and I have found them to be a perfect
            match. Communicating well, working in a team, and discipline have
            been the forefront of my soft skills that I continue to use on a
            daily basis. These skills propel my abilities to build a full stack
            application on my own and within a team.
          </p>
          <h1 id="section-experience">Experience</h1>
          <p>
            My most recent and pertinent experience to software engineering
            rests within my projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am a Customer Support Engineer. I spend my day
            interfacing with customers over the phone and email. I document
            support requests and tracks issues from the point of induction
            through resolution. I identify patterns in which a new product,
            feature, and new or additional hardware may improve the system. I
            analyze the current system's performance and make recommendations
            where necessary.
            <br /><br />
            Prior to college, I spent 5 years in the United States Army as a
            Medic. I spent 2 years attached to an infantry platoon, suppporting
            their missions and training. The last 3 years were spent as an
            Administrative Clerk where I composed reports utilizing Microsoft
            Office for the Command Team.
          </p>
          <h1 id="section-skills">Skills</h1>
          <p>
            My front-end skills reside within HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Redux.js,
            React-Native.js, Bootstrap, and Javascript. On the back-end, I work
            with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL, PostgreSql. Git and
            Github are my choices for version control. I have used AWS but
            prefer Azure as I have more experience with it. I have utilized all
            of this tech in an agile environment.
