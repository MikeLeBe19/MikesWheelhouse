					<h1 id="section-home">Welcome to my Wheelhouse!</h1>
					<p>
						This is my wheelhouse. I love developing a project from
						front to back and start to finish. Here showcases the
						work I have done, hosts my resume, and provides an
						introduction to who I am.
					</p>
					<h1 id="#section-about">About Me</h1>
					<p>
						I am a Veteran and Computer Science graduate. I enjoy
						life behind a computer creating solutions to problems. I
						really love programming. I strive to learn more all the
						time. Right now, I am working with the .NET platform,
						C#, MSSQL, and Entity framework.
					</p>
					<h1 id="section-experience">Experience</h1>
					<p>
						Prior to college, I spent 5 years in the United States
						Army as a Medic. I spent two years attached to an
						infantry platoon, suppporting their missions and
						training. The last 3 years were spent as an
						Administrative Clerk where I composed reports utilizing
						Microsoft Office for the Command Team.
					</p>
					<h1 id="section-skills">Skills</h1>
					<p>
						My frontend skills reside within HTML5, CSS3, and
						Javascript. I have knowledge of React, Angular, and Vue.
						On the flipside, I work with Node.js, C#, and Python.
						Bootstrap, Express, and Entity are nice frameworks that
						I have utilized. Git and Github are my choices for
						version control. I have used AWS but prefer Azure as I
						have more experience with it. I have utilized all of
						this tech in an agile environment.
					</p>
					<h1 id="section-education">Education</h1>
					<p>
						Lewis University, 2019-2021<br />
						Bachelor of Science in Computer Science<br />
						Western Illinois University, 2017-2018
					</p>
					<h1 id="section-projects">Projects</h1>
					<p>
						Projects in Progress: <br />
						Bug Tracker / Help-Desk Ticketing System - This project
						will demonstrate the use of Entity Framework, forms,
						validation, RESTful Services, Client-side Development,
						Authentication and Authorization, Performance
						Optimization, and deployment. This project will have
						several roles. Each role has its own responsibility to
						the system. For example, a supervisor will be able to
						delegate "tickets" to a customer service representative.
						Then the customer service representative will see the
						role assigned to them and be able to start working on
						it. More to follow...
